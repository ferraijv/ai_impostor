      "Imagine he is alive but in a coma on life support through the election.",
      "While it\u2019s all speculative, such an event would likely lead to immediate political chaos and increased polarization. There would probably be a massive nationwide investigation and a surge in conspiracy theories. Mike Pence would assume the presidency, but the repercussions on the political landscape, both domestically and internationally, would be unpredictable and significant. There could be increased tensions and protests, similar to what happened after his election, but on a larger scale.",
      "Had this attack succeeded, the GOP would have gnashed its teeth in public while its old guard silently breathed a sigh of relief and began reasserting control. The RNC would have moved to remove the Trump children from power, and a standard Republican candidate like Haley, Rubio or DeSantis would have emerged from the convention as the nominee. In fact my bet would be on a Haley-Rubio ticket.\u00a0\n\nIn response, the Dems would have completed their \u2018et tu Brute\u2019 coup against Biden, since the argument that he is the only one who could beat Trump would have dissolved. Kamala Harris would emerge as the candidate following a nasty backbiting Democratic Convention colored by accusations of racism and sexism. Her running mate is likely Shapiro to give the Dems Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\nIn a very close election, Haley wins the Presidency after a hasty debate in which she clearly defeats Kamala, and America gets its first female President. Kamala would win Pennsylvania closely but lose every other Rust Belt state plus Florida and Nevada. The Trump influence fades back into the subtextual woodwork of right wing thought, as it has before after the likes of Faubus, McCarthy and Huey P. Long.\n\nAll of which is enough to give conspiracy theorists on both sides plenty of ammo to fuel their crazy theories.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is this was a symptom of America\u2019s mass shooting culture, perpetrated by the exact same archetypal young isolated white male as every other mass shooting. He will certainly have used an AR that he likely was wearing the barrel out of at the range in recent weeks. His miss by less than two inches from 130 yards will be attributed to his nerves and his pulse rate in yanking the trigger in the heat of the moment.\u00a0\n\nMotivations are likely to be scant, but there is a better than even chance he was a QAnon guy who got disturbed by Trump\u2019s association with Epstein, spurred to act out of feelings of betrayal.\u00a0",
      "To be brutally honest, I think even if you\u2019re vehemently opposed to Trump, that is worst case scenario. He would become a martyr to all the people who adore him, and they would be invigorated by their rage to group around the next guy the republicans give them to follow"

      "I have never told anyone about this before.... but back when I was 15 (1979) I stole a Datsun 240Z car in my neighborhood. I was walking home from sa friends house one hot summer night and as I walked by this cool Z car I noticed a single key sticking out of the drivers door lock.  I had always thought that that car was cool and thought it would have been bitchin to drive.. well it was!  \nSo I kinda looked around and saw no signs of life anywhere so I got in and drove it off. It was a super nice car. I drove all around the valley (Grew up in palm springs).  This car was too nice to be treated to a joy ride so after a few hours of driving it, I took it back and parked it right back in it's parking spot at about 4am.... I figured it was very unlikely that the owner would even know it had drove, other than it missing about a 1/3rd of tank of gas. But I did keep the key, because they would think the just misplaced it somewhere. And I guess thats exactly what they did because a couple of weeks later I did the same thing, only this time it was almost out of gas so I had to put some in it.  Did the 2nd time just like the first time.\n\nAbout a week later I did it again, that time I drove it up to big bear lake because I was dying to drive it on mountain roads.... it was a blast!  Until, I stopped at a little gas/market to get a snack and bumped into one of my older brothers good friend who Knew I was only 15 and didn't have drivers licence or a car, muchless a vintage sports car.

      "I have a sweet one.\n\nMy father is convinced that lilies were my late mother's favorite flower, because their wedding venue was filled to the brim with them and she was supposed to be the one who picked the flowers. He got her lilies for every birthday, anniversary, and whenever she was in the hospital (my mother was in poor health most of her life). When she passed away, the funeral was full of lilies, and he still sometimes puts a vase of lilies beside her urn.\n\nThe thing is, my mother once confessed to me that lilies weren't her favorite flower. She was fine with them, but she preferred morning glories and sunflowers. My domineering grandmother, however, told her those weren't classy enough for a wedding and hounded her about it until my mom gave in and let her pick lilies. Mom was actually pretty wounded by how dramatic the floral arrangements ended up being - another big, showy way for her mom to say, \"I'm right and you're wrong.\" When she later voiced this, my grandmother brushed it off with, \"Please, no one's going to remember a thing about your wedding.\"\n\nBut my dad remembered. He got her lilies every day of their honeymoon, and by the end of the week she'd gone from annoyed to deeply touched. He didn't know the backstory, he just wanted to make her happy, and in doing so he kind of stripped the negative association away from them. She told me she liked that *he* gave her lilies more than flowers themselves. They turned from a symbol of being ignored to a sign that somebody was thinking of her happiness.\n\nShe swore me to secrecy, and I'll take it to the grave. RIP, Mom.\n\nUPDATE: So as many of you have said, the \"take it to the grave\" line will mock me forever, because y'all convinced me to tell my dad today. As predicted, it only took a few hours to get a \"this u?\" text from a sibling, and we all quickly conferred and agreed I should call him in the morning. \n\nAnd Dad's first reply? \"Oh yeah, I know that, morning glories were her favorite. They just don't sell bouquets of those, so I'd get her the next best thing.\" Apparently she always said lilies were her favorite, but she talked about positive memories around morning glories so much that he put two and two together.\n\nHowever, he had *no* idea that my grandmother chose the wedding flowers, and was kinda pissed to find out(\"Doesn't that just...sound like her?\"\ud83d\ude12). He wishes Mom said something, but figures maybe she didn't want to \"win\" and still end up thinking about a fight with her mom every time she looked at the flowers. He's touched to hear he made them special for her, but did say she often told him how much she appreciated it, just left out the stuff about the wedding. Interestingly, he thinks Mom actually exaggerated the honeymoon lilies; he's pretty sure he only gave her lilies twice, on the way out and on the way back home. \n\nAs I said in another post, Dad does not know what Reddit is and does not care to learn, but he thought it was nice that the story made people happy. Then he launched into telling me why I need to get a new car already, and the thread was lost lmao.\n\n\"Aw, that's good, see, you should send your little stories to the New Yorker or something! People will read them, I keep telling you!\" - My dear old dad, who only vaguely understands what my side hustle is and has adorable faith in both me and the publishing industry as a result.\n\nDad did somehow completely miss that Mom liked sunflowers, to the point that I don't think he actually believes me (\"Nah, I think you misunderstood, she liked that Van Gogh painting, that's what she meant.\" \"The painting *of sunflowers,* Babo! That's why!\"). But you can't win 'em all. \ud83d\ude02 Thanks for wrapping this up in a bow, Reddit!",

      "When  Carl Friedrich Gauss, the famous German mathematician and physicist was in elementary school (around 1784), his class was assigned the \"busy work\" task of adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 (1+2+3+4, and so on). This usually kept the class quiet for half an hour or so. Seven year-old Carl  was sitting quietly with the correct answer (5050) while the rest of the class was just starting, so the surprised teacher asked him how he came up with the solution. He replied that he added 1 and 100 and got 101. Then he added 2 and 99, and got 101, 3 plus 98 = 101, and so on. He realized there was a pattern of 50 pairs of numbers with each pair adding up to 101. And 50 x 101 = 5050.",
      "In college, my group partner was the laziest guy ever. We had to build a complex data entry system for a project, and instead of manually doing it, he wrote a script that automated most of the task in a few hours while the rest of us were planning our slow, manual approach. We might have rolled our eyes at his lack of \"effort,\" but he definitely got us through faster with that shortcut."

This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch. But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks.\" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting. And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe. He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel. \n\ni still think about it sometimes.",

      "I have two sisters. One older, and one younger. My mom worked hard to make sure each of us felt special and loved. My dad? Not so much. He called my older sister *Princess* and my little sister was referred to as *Little Buddy*. For whatever reason, I got kind of forgotten about. I didn't mind most of the time. I found my dad annoying, demanding, and at times unreasonable. I hated the way he bullied my mom and would lash out about things that didn't make sense. Basically, I thought of my dad at a total brat. He'd have a bad day at work, and would find someone to take it out on. Usually, my mom and I. But I still tried. I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower. I made gifts for him. Got good grades, won poetry contests. Won awards through bible quiz. Never argued. But it never seemed to work. Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about. Things that usually didn't make sense. If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault. My feet turn in. I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him. One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*. *I'd hit a home run*. The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, \"Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!\"\n\nAs a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone. He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you. \n\nWhen I was 15, he was almost successful. I went through a couple of really bad months. A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking. A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, \"So when are you going to get over it?\" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out. I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family. My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, \"John!\" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me. I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad. I'm not allowed to feel happy. I can't get mad. I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying. Just leave me alone, dad. Leave me alone.*\n\nThat's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me. I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work. As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully. We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship\n\nThat's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him. My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him. I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want.\n\nFast forward almost ten years later. After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid. For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him. There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me. \n\nFortunately, my dad died before the change could happen. I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied. Of course my sisters were upset. They had good relationships. But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead. No more stress. No more unreasonable expectations. The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content. \n\nI have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure. At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter. I go see him once a year. But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas. He said he couldn't. \n\nBut then he said, \"I love you, my daughter.\"\n\nSorry this was so long. I guess I needed to get that out.",
      "Probably when I was in middle school and dealing with some intense bullying. Felt completely invisible and like nobody cared. Acting out felt like the only way to get any kind of reaction. Luckily, a teacher saw what was going on and intervened before I did anything truly stupid.\n",
      "I always feel like a loser in school, I have friends but end up alone 95% of the time. It\u2019s rough dog",
      "I suppose I started the fire, actually. \n\nI was the only kid in my family to go to college. I'm from Ireland, so it wasn't a financial decision, I was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance. In my final two years of school I was studying every day, even during summer and winter holidays, from day 1. My other two siblings were at best, showing up for school, except one of them rarely did, and the other showed up high most of the time. \n\nThis was basically the way it went for my entire life, and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the \"problem children\", completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements. I was left alone to do my homework, or expected to help siblings with homework, even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework I hadn't even encountered yet. They weren't abusive parents, just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight C's, we'd go out to dinner to celebrate. I scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row, the second time I didn't even get a congratulations.\n\nSo along comes college, and with it exposure to new ideas. I come out as trans to my parents, which they ignore like most things I say. One sibling goes to work in hotels, and eventually around the world on charitourism, working to save turtles and teach kids English. The other eventually moves out of home, gets a job in a hotel he hates, and barely ever calls. I'm stuck at home (it's not common to move out in Ireland if you don't have to during college), and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day).\n\nSiblings end up back and forth of our family home, and we start to fight a lot. I'm not working, so I don't understand the real world (bare in mind I'd work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation). I'm not doing well in college anymore, so it's assumed I'm slacking off (I'm still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect). \n\nI eventually go to the United States, where I meet my now wife for the first time. We spend a glorious couple of months together before I have to travel home because yet again, I've failed college. I had one class to make up, so I put my future on hold and return to Ireland, safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in China.\n\nExcept she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after I get back. \n\nTo cut an already long story short, I finish college, and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance. We're watching a science documentary together on the television. My sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (I now have 3, but they're much younger). I correct her, and she tells me I'm wrong. When I tell her I literally have a science degree, the entire reason I'm home at all, she tells me I didn't \"really\" graduate college because I didn't have to take another exam (I was allowed to make up my grade). \n\nI lose it. I curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity, who hasn't held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school. I yell at my Dad for enabling her shit for so many years, allowing her to walk over family members because she's loud. My mother asks me what's wrong, and I tell her she's raised a hateful, spiteful daughter. \n\nI spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane. The night before, my mother tells me she'll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as I start my new life in America.\n\nShe didn't. \n\nThe fire isn't really that warm."

It was *scary* to think that I was potentially killing myself whereas a death I couldn't control or had less control over would just...happen. Then there's everyone and everything else to consider. I also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that I could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life. \n\nI found those things really hard to articulate at 19.

For more generic conditions I have previously offered my thoughts to my doctor about what it could be. Ultimately I still go to the doctor as they can prescribe drugs/order tests for me that would be difficult/questionable for me to do myself.",
      "My mom's a gp and she usually just self diagnoses most of the time but will sometimes get a second opinion. She doesn't really go to another doctor, just calls them to ask about stuff. Her contacts are filled with all kinds of doctors. Its like a secret underground community.\n\nFor stuff like getting ultrasounds etc, then yes they do discuss stuff like its a group project.",
      "Definitely go. Being your own doctor is a terrible idea, you lose all objectivity. The 'group project' thing isn't really how it is \u2013 it's more that I can usually give a solid history and understand the plan quickly. But I'm there as a patient, and they're the expert.",
      "I'm an ER doctor, and sometimes I have other doctors as patients.\n\nFor the most part they're pretty good patients because they can give a good description of their symptoms in a way that's useful the me.  They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment.  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my \"patient talk\" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople.  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding.\n\nThe worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything.  Some version of: \"My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose...\"\n\nAs far as self diagnosing, I usually deal with my own minor medical issues.  If I noticed signs of something more serious, I would go to someone else."

Could you see that person as another human being that needed help, or were your personal feelings about the abhorrent behaviour too strong? \nThis factor lead some people to not continue my course on to the next level, but it really illustrates the level of non judgement needed in this field. We all have our own personal feelings, of course, but these get talked about in supervision.\n\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for the awards. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s raised an interesting topic for discussion, I\u2019m enjoying reading them all, even if I don\u2019t have the time to reply. \n\nPersonally, in this instance I remember the Gandhi quote \u201chate the sin, not the sinner\u201d.\n\nAlso spelling.",
      "When you as a therapist get to that point, it's time to start thinking of referrals.\n\nBe genuine with your client.  And then refer out.  You have to have unconditional positive regard or you'll never achieve therapeutic rapport.  \n\nI think for me, the one that comes to mind is a frequent caller to the suicide hotlines.  He'd call in and say he's not providing his phone number or name, he would just say that you had 10 seconds to convince him not to kill himself over the phone, or he'd blow his brains out and it'd be your fault.  Then he'd count down from 10 to 1 while you're on the phone talking.  At one, he'd hang up.\n\nI'm sure the whole point was to make me feel bad or prove some point, I don't know, I have insufficient information to make an assessment with just that. But I have to admit when I was trying to sleep on days he'd call, especially the first time, I was thinking, \"fucking asshole better not be dead, fucker...\"",
      "I feel like a lot of the comments saying that they NEVER judge their clients might be working in voluntary services or they\u2019ve been very fortunate in their client base. \nJudgement isn\u2019t an inherently bad thing. It\u2019s how we know that murdering people is wrong. \n\nSo when a convicted pedophile client told me, \u201cnothing gets me going like a pair of little girl\u2019s worn panties\u201d, you better believe I judged the fuck out of him. I continued to work with him and I treated him with compassion and respect because he\u2019s a human being worthy of both; I did my job because I\u2019m a professional. But I can\u2019t honestly say that I didn\u2019t judge him. I judged that he should never be around children. I judged that he is not yet ready for change. I judged that his access to his own daughter should be closely supervised. That\u2019s a lot of judgements. \n\nUnderstanding your own inherent biases and how they influence your work is a very important part of training and practice.",

      "Schools have these already and the kids in them don't care. It's not immediately relevant to their lives so they don't pay attention. Sorta like if I were to talk to you about the do's and don'ts of denture cream. You say, \"eh, I'll figure it out later when I need to know it\" and stop paying attention.\n\nI've taught in several schools that have tried to teach social skills, kindness, meditation, financial literacy, etc. In every case, the kids did not care. It was their least favorite part of the day because it felt like a waste of time.\n\nThe point of education is to teach thinking, not doing. A well-educated student can teach themselves these things. A quick Google search can teach you how to file taxes, cook, etc. But you can't Google how to do Algebra 2 and expect to understand what you read without some background in the subject matter.\n\nEdit: I got upvotes? Now I'm mad with power, so I'll say this: \n\nI hear arguments like this post all the time, and I think the real issue is people not taking responsibility. \"I can't cook? That must be the school's fault! We need education reform!\" No, it's not the school's fault. It's your fault. You could literally Google a recipe in 20 seconds. Stop blaming other people for your problems.\n\nPeople don't realize that the point of education isn't to teach facts, but the change your brain. For example, physics and math majors earn the highest scores in the MCAT, GMAT, and LSAT.

Neither of our species can fly. But with peace as a possibility, perhaps we can both soar...",

      "Am a man, but the fall of Constantinople closed off Europe's trade routes with Asia (specifically China and India). The Ottomans charged enormous taxes on goods passing through their territory, if they even let goods through at all. This led to Europeans looking for new trade routes. The Portuguese were already a pretty navally focused kingdom and were geographically situated the best to begin naval exploration. So they started trading down the West coast of Africa, eventually rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Sea. These expeditions allowed the Portuguese to develop their naval technology to the point where they could start venturing out into the Atlantic, beyond the sight of land and still reliably navigate. This led to the discovery of the Azores, which sparked a lot of interest in Europe. It was the first time in living memory new lands had been discovered.\n\nPortugal's new trade wealth sparked competition with their newly united rival and Iberian peninsula neighbors, the Spanish Kingdoms. The Spanish began funding their own trade voyages to try to compete with Portugal, including, famously, a Genoese explorer named Christopher Columbus.\n\nMore than half a millennia later people descended from Europeans who colonized the lands Columbus \"discovered\" for Europe elected an orange fascist president. So I personally blame Mehmed II for Trump's election.",

I wasn't used to the attention and it definitely got to my teenage head.

She just lit up when she saw me, she was so excited, and I ... I was a shitty teenager and I just ignored her. I pretended I didn't recognize her. She looked so deflated when I didn't acknowledge her.   \n\n  \n\nNote this was the 90's.  My family moved a few times after that. I settled down in a different part of the country after University.  I never made it back to that town.  I've relived that asshole moment for years now.

      "I love this idea in theory but I think the practicalities would be really challenging. Like, how do you navigate inheritance issues, medical decisions, end-of-life care responsibilities? With child adoption there's a clear legal framework but this would be completely uncharted territory. That said, there are already informal versions of this happening - I know several people who basically became surrogate family for elderly neighbors or family friends. Maybe we just need better community programs to facilitate these natural connections rather than trying to formalize it legally.",
      "There is actually a program that kind of meets this need where I live. People can sign up for a \u2018rented\u2019 grandparent. It allows families that have no living grandparents or no or limited contact with the grandparents to have grandparents in their life. \n\nIt helps elderly people who want social contact and it helps families who want their children to experience grandparents. \n\nHow you interact with the \u2018rented\u2019 grandparents is up to you and your \u2018rented\u2019 grandparent. So if you want to do a lot together, they match you with someone who wants to be very active. If you want someone more laid back they match you with a laidback person\n\nEdit: They are called 'rental' or 'borrowed' grandparents. You don't actually pay to spend time with them. Should have probably clarified that.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award. If you like this, you might like the following information and article. People are starting to combine nursing homes and preschools because the children benefit from the elderly and the elderly benefit from the children. https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/01/the-preschool-inside-a-nursing-home/424827/\n\nEdit: Thanks for the second award.

    "comments": [
      "I used to do salmon spawning surveys, which involved walking up streams looking for fish. Some of the streams are quite remote and/or inaccessible on timber land, and you don\u2019t really expect to see any other person when you\u2019re out there. As a naturally smile-y, friendly, small feminine woman, I\u2019ve learned to be wary of people 100% of the time in the field. I actively try to avoid running into people when I\u2019m alone in remote places.\n\nOne of the survey locations is close to a highway. To get to it, I had to park at a pullout, follow a river downstream to a flagged trail, hike over a ridge to meet up with an old logging road on private timber land. I walked along the logging road for about 100 m before peeling off into the woods (very thick second growth Douglas fir reprod), where game trails eventually lead to the stream at the base of the hill slope. I came here during spring to survey steelhead, but this stream was also a survey location for other types of salmon during the fall. The game trails off of the logging road were flagged by previous surveyors, and multiple routes were marked. This made it kind of confusing, and not all routes actually led to the stream. Some just petered out once the vegetation got too thick. Another led to a cliff face overlooking the riverbed. Lots of faint trails. \n\nOne day I turned off into the woods one of the survey flags tied around a branch at the side of the road. I followed some pink flagging heading south along the hillside. I noticed the trail seemed freshly turned up, and figured maybe a bear clambered through recently since the time I was there last (2 weeks previously). The trail led to a small claustrophobic clearing, and the ground was freshly torn up in the shape of a circle. Seemed strange. I was looking for elk tracks but didn\u2019t see any. Then I noticed an assortment of bones scattered around the edges of the clearing. These weren\u2019t there before. Everything was dead silent, and something about it was setting me on edge. I poked around the bones a bit, trying to piece together this scene. I noticed another slight path, which strayed from my main route, veering to the right from the clearing. I walked a bit down that way, and gazed ahead trying to see if this path was flagged. It was densely packed with trees.  A subtle movement caught the corner of my eye ahead and to the right as I walked \u2014 I turned my head to look past the trees and saw the silhouette of a large shelter maybe about 50-75 feet from the clearing. It was surrounded by what looked to be jugs and bones. Tons of plastic jugs. Light shapes of bones on the ground. The lighting made seeing anything else impossible. Everything was so, so quiet. \n\nI left in a hurry, off the trail, without trying to get a better look, without getting to the stream. The alarm bells in my brain were screaming.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if the movement I saw was just a trick of the eye or if there was actually something moving. My gut feeling was someone was present at the shelter when I was there. \n\nAnother clarification, the jugs were large (e.g. not plastic milk jugs). More like chemical containers. It wasn\u2019t random trash strewn around the shelter. It was jugs and lots of bones.",

We see him pull up so we take off running to hide. It\u2019s funny because they have to wander around somewhere they\u2019re unfamiliar with or go ask my parents and be told too bad you\u2019ll have to find her. It\u2019s like forced hide and seek. Anyway this one night I saw my friend hide in one building while I ran for the trees. I was hiding under some bushes and heard breathing. Like human breathing. There were no animals around. It creeped me out so bad I ran out of hiding to greet my friend. I felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the night. Some time during the night my dad heard something and went out to investigate. In the morning he discovered that one of our cows was killed and butchered."
