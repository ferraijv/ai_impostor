      "Imagine he is alive but in a coma on life support through the election.",
      "While it\u2019s all speculative, such an event would likely lead to immediate political chaos and increased polarization. There would probably be a massive nationwide investigation and a surge in conspiracy theories. Mike Pence would assume the presidency, but the repercussions on the political landscape, both domestically and internationally, would be unpredictable and significant. There could be increased tensions and protests, similar to what happened after his election, but on a larger scale.",
      "Had this attack succeeded, the GOP would have gnashed its teeth in public while its old guard silently breathed a sigh of relief and began reasserting control. The RNC would have moved to remove the Trump children from power, and a standard Republican candidate like Haley, Rubio or DeSantis would have emerged from the convention as the nominee. In fact my bet would be on a Haley-Rubio ticket.\u00a0\n\nIn response, the Dems would have completed their \u2018et tu Brute\u2019 coup against Biden, since the argument that he is the only one who could beat Trump would have dissolved. Kamala Harris would emerge as the candidate following a nasty backbiting Democratic Convention colored by accusations of racism and sexism. Her running mate is likely Shapiro to give the Dems Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\nIn a very close election, Haley wins the Presidency after a hasty debate in which she clearly defeats Kamala, and America gets its first female President. Kamala would win Pennsylvania closely but lose every other Rust Belt state plus Florida and Nevada. The Trump influence fades back into the subtextual woodwork of right wing thought, as it has before after the likes of Faubus, McCarthy and Huey P. Long.\n\nAll of which is enough to give conspiracy theorists on both sides plenty of ammo to fuel their crazy theories.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is this was a symptom of America\u2019s mass shooting culture, perpetrated by the exact same archetypal young isolated white male as every other mass shooting. He will certainly have used an AR that he likely was wearing the barrel out of at the range in recent weeks. His miss by less than two inches from 130 yards will be attributed to his nerves and his pulse rate in yanking the trigger in the heat of the moment.\u00a0\n\nMotivations are likely to be scant, but there is a better than even chance he was a QAnon guy who got disturbed by Trump\u2019s association with Epstein, spurred to act out of feelings of betrayal.\u00a0",
      "To be brutally honest, I think even if you\u2019re vehemently opposed to Trump, that is worst case scenario. He would become a martyr to all the people who adore him, and they would be invigorated by their rage to group around the next guy the republicans give them to follow"

      "I have never told anyone about this before.... but back when I was 15 (1979) I stole a Datsun 240Z car in my neighborhood. I was walking home from sa friends house one hot summer night and as I walked by this cool Z car I noticed a single key sticking out of the drivers door lock.  I had always thought that that car was cool and thought it would have been bitchin to drive.. well it was!  \nSo I kinda looked around and saw no signs of life anywhere so I got in and drove it off. It was a super nice car. I drove all around the valley (Grew up in palm springs).  This car was too nice to be treated to a joy ride so after a few hours of driving it, I took it back and parked it right back in it's parking spot at about 4am.... I figured it was very unlikely that the owner would even know it had drove, other than it missing about a 1/3rd of tank of gas. But I did keep the key, because they would think the just misplaced it somewhere. And I guess thats exactly what they did because a couple of weeks later I did the same thing, only this time it was almost out of gas so I had to put some in it.  Did the 2nd time just like the first time.\n\nAbout a week later I did it again, that time I drove it up to big bear lake because I was dying to drive it on mountain roads.... it was a blast!  Until, I stopped at a little gas/market to get a snack and bumped into one of my older brothers good friend who Knew I was only 15 and didn't have drivers licence or a car, muchless a vintage sports car.  I can't remember the lies I told him but knew I was going to be in deep shit when I got home.  I hauled ass back to PS, stopped at 7/11 and filled the car with gas and snuck it back into their driveway, took a pen and scribbled out a thank you note and told them that I really loved their car  and they really shouldn't leave the key in the door overnight.. oh and btw, I filled the tank for you.

      "I have a sweet one.\n\nMy father is convinced that lilies were my late mother's favorite flower, because their wedding venue was filled to the brim with them and she was supposed to be the one who picked the flowers. He got her lilies for every birthday, anniversary, and whenever she was in the hospital (my mother was in poor health most of her life). When she passed away, the funeral was full of lilies, and he still sometimes puts a vase of lilies beside her urn.\n\nThe thing is, my mother once confessed to me that lilies weren't her favorite flower. She was fine with them, but she preferred morning glories and sunflowers. My domineering grandmother, however, told her those weren't classy enough for a wedding and hounded her about it until my mom gave in and let her pick lilies. Mom was actually pretty wounded by how dramatic the floral arrangements ended up being - another big, showy way for her mom to say, \"I'm right and you're wrong.\" When she later voiced this, my grandmother brushed it off with, \"Please, no one's going to remember a thing about your wedding.\"\n\nBut my dad remembered. He got her lilies every day of their honeymoon, and by the end of the week she'd gone from annoyed to deeply touched. He didn't know the backstory, he just wanted to make her happy, and in doing so he kind of stripped the negative association away from them. She told me she liked that *he* gave her lilies more than flowers themselves. They turned from a symbol of being ignored to a sign that somebody was thinking of her happiness.\n\nShe swore me to secrecy, and I'll take it to the grave. RIP, Mom.\n\nUPDATE: So as many of you have said, the \"take it to the grave\" line will mock me forever, because y'all convinced me to tell my dad today. As predicted, it only took a few hours to get a \"this u?\" text from a sibling, and we all quickly conferred and agreed I should call him in the morning. \n\nAnd Dad's first reply? \"Oh yeah, I know that, morning glories were her favorite. They just don't sell bouquets of those, so I'd get her the next best thing.\" Apparently she always said lilies were her favorite, but she talked about positive memories around morning glories so much that he put two and two together.\n\nHowever, he had *no* idea that my grandmother chose the wedding flowers, and was kinda pissed to find out(\"Doesn't that just...sound like her?\"\ud83d\ude12). He wishes Mom said something, but figures maybe she didn't want to \"win\" and still end up thinking about a fight with her mom every time she looked at the flowers. He's touched to hear he made them special for her, but did say she often told him how much she appreciated it, just left out the stuff about the wedding. Interestingly, he thinks Mom actually exaggerated the honeymoon lilies; he's pretty sure he only gave her lilies twice, on the way out and on the way back home. \n\nAs I said in another post, Dad does not know what Reddit is and does not care to learn, but he thought it was nice that the story made people happy. Then he launched into telling me why I need to get a new car already, and the thread was lost lmao.\n\n\"Aw, that's good, see, you should send your little stories to the New Yorker or something! People will read them, I keep telling you!\" - My dear old dad, who only vaguely understands what my side hustle is and has adorable faith in both me and the publishing industry as a result.\n\nDad did somehow completely miss that Mom liked sunflowers, to the point that I don't think he actually believes me (\"Nah, I think you misunderstood, she liked that Van Gogh painting, that's what she meant.\" \"The painting *of sunflowers,* Babo! That's why!\"). But you can't win 'em all. \ud83d\ude02 Thanks for wrapping this up in a bow, Reddit!",

      "The man who redirected an entire warship to get the sun off his eyes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch. But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks.\" And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting. And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe. He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel. \n\ni still think about it sometimes.",

I'd try to cuddle up with him, feeling hurt when he'd shrug me off and tell me I need to shower. I made gifts for him. Got good grades, won poetry contests. Won awards through bible quiz. Never argued. But it never seemed to work. Before long, he'd find something to yell at me about. Things that usually didn't make sense. If my little sister and I fought, the whole thing was my fault. My feet turn in. I hated when my dad would come to my sporting events, because seeing me run with inturned feet seemed to be humiliating for him. One time I was running from one base to another, feeling exhilaration because *I'd done it*. *I'd hit a home run*. The smile died on my face when I heard my dad yell, \"Run with your feet straight! You look stupid!\"\n\nAs a teen, my mom really stepped up and started insisting that he was going to leave me alone. He was never physically abusive, but the way he talked to you made you feel like he was trying to say something that would break you. \n\nWhen I was 15, he was almost successful. I went through a couple of really bad months. A friend died, my dog died, we moved, and my mental health was tanking. A week after my friend died (car accident), my dad asked, \"So when are you going to get over it?\" It took me by surprise, because at that time, I wasn't crying or acting out. I was just sitting there, eating dinner with the family. My mom immediately reacted, gasping out a surprised, \"John!\" and the two of them began fighting again, over my dad's need to mess with me. I sat there, head down on the table, thinking, *I'm not allowed to be sad. I'm not allowed to feel happy. I can't get mad. I'm in pain, and he finds it annoying. Just leave me alone, dad. Leave me alone.*\n\nThat's when it clicked: my dad, for whatever reason, seemed to hate me. I could try to make him like me, but it wasn't going to work. As I got older, my goal became to avoid him, his seemed to be to forge a relationship with me with the sole purpose of having a target for his need to bully. We were never going to have a healthy father-daughter relationship\n\nThat's when it clicked: it's not me, it's him. My sisters could like and love him, but I didn't need to respect him. I was done trying to please him, trying to do the right things, trying to be the daughter that my dad seemed to want.\n\nFast forward almost ten years later. After the birth of my son, my dad had tried to begin a new relationship with me, because for whatever reason, he latched on to my kid. For the sake of my kid, I let my dad have a relationship with him, but I was always monitoring, waiting for my son to develop a personality that would change the way my dad saw him. There was no way I was going to let my dad do to my son what he did to me. \n\nFortunately, my dad died before the change could happen. I sat in the back at his funeral, dry eyed and satisfied. Of course my sisters were upset. They had good relationships. But for me and my mom, it kind of felt like the wicked witch was at long last dead. No more stress. No more unreasonable expectations. The egg shells we'd been walking on were swept away, and we could be content. \n\nI have an uncle in West Virginia that I started to see as my father-figure. At first, I jokingly would call him dad, testing the waters, waiting for him to remind me that he actually has kids, and doesn't need an adopted daughter. I go see him once a year. But I always felt like maybe, he sees my need to see him as a dad to be annoying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked him if he was coming up for Christmas. He said he couldn't. \n\nBut then he said, \"I love you, my daughter.\"\n\nSorry this was so long. I guess I needed to get that out.",
      "Probably when I was in middle school and dealing with some intense bullying. Felt completely invisible and like nobody cared. Acting out felt like the only way to get any kind of reaction. Luckily, a teacher saw what was going on and intervened before I did anything truly stupid.\n",
      "I always feel like a loser in school, I have friends but end up alone 95% of the time. It\u2019s rough dog",
      "I suppose I started the fire, actually. \n\nI was the only kid in my family to go to college. I'm from Ireland, so it wasn't a financial decision, I was just the only one who worked hard enough in school to have any chance. In my final two years of school I was studying every day, even during summer and winter holidays, from day 1. My other two siblings were at best, showing up for school, except one of them rarely did, and the other showed up high most of the time. \n\nThis was basically the way it went for my entire life, and during that time my parents had focused their attention on the \"problem children\", completely ignoring my needs wants or achievements. I was left alone to do my homework, or expected to help siblings with homework, even though one of them was older than me and was tackling coursework I hadn't even encountered yet. They weren't abusive parents, just bad ones - if my brother or sister got straight C's, we'd go out to dinner to celebrate. I scored in the top 5% for math scores in the country twice in a row, the second time I didn't even get a congratulations.\n\nSo along comes college, and with it exposure to new ideas. I come out as trans to my parents, which they ignore like most things I say. One sibling goes to work in hotels, and eventually around the world on charitourism, working to save turtles and teach kids English. The other eventually moves out of home, gets a job in a hotel he hates, and barely ever calls. I'm stuck at home (it's not common to move out in Ireland if you don't have to during college), and not able to work due to the high workload in college and the long commute (4 hours a day).\n\nSiblings end up back and forth of our family home, and we start to fight a lot. I'm not working, so I don't understand the real world (bare in mind I'd work 40 hours a week during the summer vacation). I'm not doing well in college anymore, so it's assumed I'm slacking off (I'm still in therapy and on medication for depression brought on by stress and neglect). \n\nI eventually go to the United States, where I meet my now wife for the first time. We spend a glorious couple of months together before I have to travel home because yet again, I've failed college. I had one class to make up, so I put my future on hold and return to Ireland, safe in the knowledge that at least my sister is still in China.\n\nExcept she surprises the whole family by coming home for good three days after I get back. \n\nTo cut an already long story short, I finish college, and am a week away from flying back to my now fiance. We're watching a science documentary together on the television. My sister is starts explaining something about it wrong to the youngest sibling (I now have 3, but they're much younger). I correct her, and she tells me I'm wrong. When I tell her I literally have a science degree, the entire reason I'm home at all, she tells me I didn't \"really\" graduate college because I didn't have to take another exam (I was allowed to make up my grade). \n\nI lose it. I curse her out for being an awful bitch who talks down to everyone at every available opportunity, who hasn't held a real job for 3 years and barely limped her out of high school. I yell at my Dad for enabling her shit for so many years, allowing her to walk over family members because she's loud. My mother asks me what's wrong, and I tell her she's raised a hateful, spiteful daughter. \n\nI spend the next week at a friends house before travelling home and packing up my things to load onto the airplane. The night before, my mother tells me she'll get up in the morning to wish my goodbye and goodluck as I start my new life in America.\n\nShe didn't. \n\nThe fire isn't really that warm."

I think the hardest thing for non-suicidal people to understand is that a lot of suicidal people don't want to kill themselves, they just want to stop existing. \n\nActually going through the steps of writing a note and taking the pills was extremely difficult and all I kept thinking the whole time was that it would be so much easier if I could just fall asleep and never wake up. It was *scary* to think that I was potentially killing myself whereas a death I couldn't control or had less control over would just...happen. Then there's everyone and everything else to consider. I also have caught myself wishing many times that the whole world would end so that I could stop existing but then neither myself nor my loved ones would have to deal with the pain or miss out on a good life. \n\nI found those things really hard to articulate at 19. It's how a lot of depressed people feel. ",

      "During my training I was asked how would you feel if a client were to come to you and admitted they were a paedophile that was on the edge of committing seriously horrific acts? Could you see that person as another human being that needed help, or were your personal feelings about the abhorrent behaviour too strong? \nThis factor lead some people to not continue my course on to the next level, but it really illustrates the level of non judgement needed in this field. We all have our own personal feelings, of course, but these get talked about in supervision.\n\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for the awards. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s raised an interesting topic for discussion, I\u2019m enjoying reading them all, even if I don\u2019t have the time to reply. \n\nPersonally, in this instance I remember the Gandhi quote \u201chate the sin, not the sinner\u201d.\n\nAlso spelling.",
      "When you as a therapist get to that point, it's time to start thinking of referrals.\n\nBe genuine with your client.  And then refer out.  You have to have unconditional positive regard or you'll never achieve therapeutic rapport.  \n\nI think for me, the one that comes to mind is a frequent caller to the suicide hotlines.  He'd call in and say he's not providing his phone number or name, he would just say that you had 10 seconds to convince him not to kill himself over the phone, or he'd blow his brains out and it'd be your fault.  Then he'd count down from 10 to 1 while you're on the phone talking.  At one, he'd hang up.\n\nI'm sure the whole point was to make me feel bad or prove some point, I don't know, I have insufficient information to make an assessment with just that. But I have to admit when I was trying to sleep on days he'd call, especially the first time, I was thinking, \"fucking asshole better not be dead, fucker...\"",
      "I feel like a lot of the comments saying that they NEVER judge their clients might be working in voluntary services or they\u2019ve been very fortunate in their client base. \nJudgement isn\u2019t an inherently bad thing. It\u2019s how we know that murdering people is wrong. \n\nSo when a convicted pedophile client told me, \u201cnothing gets me going like a pair of little girl\u2019s worn panties\u201d, you better believe I judged the fuck out of him. I continued to work with him and I treated him with compassion and respect because he\u2019s a human being worthy of both; I did my job because I\u2019m a professional. But I can\u2019t honestly say that I didn\u2019t judge him. I judged that he should never be around children. I judged that he is not yet ready for change. I judged that his access to his own daughter should be closely supervised. That\u2019s a lot of judgements. \n\nUnderstanding your own inherent biases and how they influence your work is a very important part of training and practice.",

      "Schools have these already and the kids in them don't care. It's not immediately relevant to their lives so they don't pay attention. Sorta like if I were to talk to you about the do's and don'ts of denture cream. You say, \"eh, I'll figure it out later when I need to know it\" and stop paying attention.\n\nI've taught in several schools that have tried to teach social skills, kindness, meditation, financial literacy, etc. In every case, the kids did not care. It was their least favorite part of the day because it felt like a waste of time.\n\nThe point of education is to teach thinking, not doing. A well-educated student can teach themselves these things. A quick Google search can teach you how to file taxes, cook, etc. But you can't Google how to do Algebra 2 and expect to understand what you read without some background in the subject matter.\n\nEdit: I got upvotes? Now I'm mad with power, so I'll say this: \n\nI hear arguments like this post all the time, and I think the real issue is people not taking responsibility. \"I can't cook? That must be the school's fault! We need education reform!\" No, it's not the school's fault. It's your fault. You could literally Google a recipe in 20 seconds. Stop blaming other people for your problems.\n\nPeople don't realize that the point of education isn't to teach facts, but the change your brain. For example, physics and math majors earn the highest scores in the MCAT, GMAT, and LSAT. It's not because they learned those things in class, but because their curriculum emphasizes logical thinking.

The plant manager would not accept a meeting and I finally found him up at the water cooler.  I told him I wanted to hash this out today (it was the 2 week mark on the dot) and he said \"I don't have time for you\".

      "It was a monumental loss, culturally and historically. The end of Byzantium like that, after a thousand years, is just wild to think about.",
      "Am a man, but the fall of Constantinople closed off Europe's trade routes with Asia (specifically China and India). The Ottomans charged enormous taxes on goods passing through their territory, if they even let goods through at all. This led to Europeans looking for new trade routes. The Portuguese were already a pretty navally focused kingdom and were geographically situated the best to begin naval exploration. So they started trading down the West coast of Africa, eventually rounding the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Sea. These expeditions allowed the Portuguese to develop their naval technology to the point where they could start venturing out into the Atlantic, beyond the sight of land and still reliably navigate. This led to the discovery of the Azores, which sparked a lot of interest in Europe. It was the first time in living memory new lands had been discovered.\n\nPortugal's new trade wealth sparked competition with their newly united rival and Iberian peninsula neighbors, the Spanish Kingdoms. The Spanish began funding their own trade voyages to try to compete with Portugal, including, famously, a Genoese explorer named Christopher Columbus.\n\nMore than half a millennia later people descended from Europeans who colonized the lands Columbus \"discovered\" for Europe elected an orange fascist president. So I personally blame Mehmed II for Trump's election.",

For High School, I received an academic scholarship to a private Catholic school. it was a really big deal for my family.  I didn't know anyone at the new school. between an odd combination of academics, sports and the tail end of puberty, I became very popular in this new school. I wasn't used to the attention and it definitely got to my teenage head.  Nearly all of my social circles became around the new school and not with my old local friends.  \n\n  \n\nI'm in my junior year, I head to a McDonalds for lunch with a few friends from the new school. working the counter, I see a girl who i used to go to public school with that I used to have a crush on. She just lit up when she saw me, she was so excited, and I ... I was a shitty teenager and I just ignored her. I pretended I didn't recognize her. She looked so deflated when I didn't acknowledge her.   \n\n  \n\nNote this was the 90's.  My family moved a few times after that. I settled down in a different part of the country after University.  I never made it back to that town.  I've relived that asshole moment for years now. Fast forward to one of those nights when I relive that moment, and I decide to look her up on Facebook to apologize. I find out she died 10 years ago in an auto accident.  since I found out her fate, I feel even more awful about that moment.",

With child adoption there's a clear legal framework but this would be completely uncharted territory. That said, there are already informal versions of this happening - I know several people who basically became surrogate family for elderly neighbors or family friends. Maybe we just need better community programs to facilitate these natural connections rather than trying to formalize it legally.",

So if you want to do a lot together, they match you with someone who wants to be very active.

      "I used to do salmon spawning surveys, which involved walking up streams looking for fish. Some of the streams are quite remote and/or inaccessible on timber land, and you don\u2019t really expect to see any other person when you\u2019re out there. As a naturally smile-y, friendly, small feminine woman, I\u2019ve learned to be wary of people 100% of the time in the field. I actively try to avoid running into people when I\u2019m alone in remote places.\n\nOne of the survey locations is close to a highway. To get to it, I had to park at a pullout, follow a river downstream to a flagged trail, hike over a ridge to meet up with an old logging road on private timber land. I walked along the logging road for about 100 m before peeling off into the woods (very thick second growth Douglas fir reprod), where game trails eventually lead to the stream at the base of the hill slope. I came here during spring to survey steelhead, but this stream was also a survey location for other types of salmon during the fall. The game trails off of the logging road were flagged by previous surveyors, and multiple routes were marked. This made it kind of confusing, and not all routes actually led to the stream. Some just petered out once the vegetation got too thick. Another led to a cliff face overlooking the riverbed. Lots of faint trails. \n\nOne day I turned off into the woods one of the survey flags tied around a branch at the side of the road. I followed some pink flagging heading south along the hillside. I noticed the trail seemed freshly turned up, and figured maybe a bear clambered through recently since the time I was there last (2 weeks previously). The trail led to a small claustrophobic clearing, and the ground was freshly torn up in the shape of a circle. Seemed strange. I was looking for elk tracks but didn\u2019t see any. Then I noticed an assortment of bones scattered around the edges of the clearing. These weren\u2019t there before. Everything was dead silent, and something about it was setting me on edge. I poked around the bones a bit, trying to piece together this scene. I noticed another slight path, which strayed from my main route, veering to the right from the clearing. I walked a bit down that way, and gazed ahead trying to see if this path was flagged. It was densely packed with trees.  A subtle movement caught the corner of my eye ahead and to the right as I walked \u2014 I turned my head to look past the trees and saw the silhouette of a large shelter maybe about 50-75 feet from the clearing. It was surrounded by what looked to be jugs and bones. Tons of plastic jugs. Light shapes of bones on the ground. The lighting made seeing anything else impossible. Everything was so, so quiet. \n\nI left in a hurry, off the trail, without trying to get a better look, without getting to the stream. The alarm bells in my brain were screaming.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if the movement I saw was just a trick of the eye or if there was actually something moving. My gut feeling was someone was present at the shelter when I was there. \n\nAnother clarification, the jugs were large (e.g. not plastic milk jugs). More like chemical containers. It wasn\u2019t random trash strewn around the shelter. It was jugs and lots of bones.",

Anyway this one night I saw my friend hide in one building while I ran for the trees. I was hiding under some bushes and heard breathing. Like human breathing. There were no animals around. It creeped me out so bad I ran out of hiding to greet my friend. I felt so uncomfortable for the rest of the night. Some time during the night my dad heard something and went out to investigate. In the morning he discovered that one of our cows was killed and butchered."

      "Hello, therapist here. There are several:\n\n1. Speaking to their departed loved ones. Thankfully, theories now support this and don't consider it to be a sign they're not \"moving on with their lives\". I encourage my clients to explore the continuation of their relationships with the deceased. \n\n2. Small ways they've made progress in the week. I know this isn't technically weird, but my clients sometimes don't want to tell me this, either because they fear I'd turn round and say they don't need therapy any more, or because I might find the progress unnoteworthy. Both of which are totally untrue!\n\n3. That they're having bizarre intrusive thoughts of hurting themselves/others, sexual fantasies and so on. As a therapist, I'm trained to appreciate the whole world that lies between thoughts and action, and all it really proves is that we have an imagination. It's highly unlikely I'll need to break confidentiality, and won't call the police immediately. \n\n4. Sex related things in general. Eventually we'll talk about sex, and I'll see a weight lifted off their shoulders for how unphased I am by their apparently weird sex life. Honestly, it's rarely that weird, and we all have kinks. Life is fruitful, there's no need to be ashamed.",

Pearson Vue has seized a huge amount of this space, which just adds to the cost, and tries to enforce certification tracks with government contract specs and all sorts of inroads.\n* The \"cash cow\" of graduating college with 6 figure jobs waiting for them is mostly gone.  The junior roles have been outsourced overseas, and have been replaced with people with multiple hats. There are very few \"middle roles,\" so the track of going from junior to senior has a HUGE gap that keeps getting wider.\n* The senior roles are starting to age out: many went into management, and some are retiring.  Knowledge and experience is getting lost.\n* Companies reliant on technology to surve are cutting technology costs as a \"cost center\" because of the pressure of rising capitalism always producing value year to year. Thus, they send more jobs overseas, and senior roles become too costly to maintain.\n* We are incurring a lot of \"debt\" in aging infrastructure, and IT is no different. There are systems operating high-cost operations in factories, transportation, and utilities that haven't been upgraded in decades, and some of the people who knew how it all worked are dying off.\n\nEventually, there won't be enough senior roles to teacher younger people anything, and there will be a cascading series of knowledge gaps in current infrastructure, leading to huge failures.

I was going maybe 5 mph over the speed limit to pass a slow car when a car came up on my tail. The road wasn't limited access and had a lot of blind driveways. Going more than 55 really wasn't safe. The highway, named Dixie Highway, has also been referred to as Dixie Die-Way. \n\nAnyway, I passed the slow car as quickly as I could safely do so then pulled over to the right as soon as I was safely in front of the slow vehicle. The guy who'd been riding my tail passed me at a high rate of speed and I held up the third finger as he passed. Ooops. The driver obviously saw it as he pulled in front of me the instant he was past me and jammed on his brakes. I was so relieved that I didn't lose control of the car.

      "That paralysis when you *need* to do a simple thing like make a phone call or start laundry, but your brain just... won't. It's not laziness, it's like hitting an invisible wall. People think we just need to focus more, but they don't get how overwhelming even small tasks can feel sometimes.\n\nAlso, the emotional dysregulation. Something minor can feel like the end of the world for a minute, then it passes. And the constant mental noise, trying to filter everything is exhausting. It's not just being easily distracted.",
      "That meds really make a huge difference. I was diagnosed at 36 after two graduate degrees and a bar exam. I was so pissed off when I got meds because I suddenly didn't have to spend 40% of my brain power hacking my brain. It's like a computer constantly running adobe Photoshop or some other massive program in the background. It slows everything down.\n\nI could have fucking been President by now with a childhood diagnosis and access to drugs. It's this easy for neurotypicals? You just DO THE THING? What the fuck.",
      "I wish people understood that ADHD doesn\u2019t just affect your ability to focus. It really needs to be renamed. ADHD changes your brain chemistry and the way that different parts of the brain communicate with each other, which means that it has a TON of symptoms that affect every part of our daily lives. \n\nWe have trouble with executive function, which means that no matter how hard we may want to do something, we may not be able to force ourselves to do it.\n\nWe struggle with motivation because every task is high priority, yet our brains don\u2019t reward us for completing them.\n\nWe have sensory issues because we cannot control which things to pay attention to and which things to block out. Some of us, like me, are not capable of blocking anything out unless we\u2019re hyper focused, in which case I will sometimes literally forget to breathe.\n\nWe have auditory processing issues, and I couldn\u2019t tell you why. As far as I know, it\u2019s just to make our lives harder. On the bad days, speech has no meaning, it\u2019s just sound. It\u2019s like the adults talking in Peanuts cartoons. We want to listen, but it\u2019s just noise.\n\nWe have trouble regulating our emotions. It\u2019s different for everyone, but for me, emotions are either unbearably intense or nonexistent and there is no middle ground. \n\nThere\u2019s so much going on for us at any given moment that it\u2019s no wonder we can\u2019t pay attention. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s not cute or funny, even though we do enjoy poking fun at ourselves. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a stretch to say that most of us would give anything to have our brains function normally.",
      "Object permanence. If an object doesn\u2019t have a home where it belongs, it ends up in a pile or lost. If I can\u2019t see something, I forget it exists.

I have to fold my clothes and stack them on a shelf where I can see them at a glance. Food often gets tossed to my chickens because I\u2019ve found it at the back of the fridge when it\u2019s already past its prime. Grocery shopping once a week is really difficult because I have to plan and shop for a week\u2019s worth of meals rather than just a meal or two that are on my mind at the moment.\n\nEdit: this started as a list. As someone pointed out below, this is not the definition of object permanence (though some people who have ADHD do struggle with it, myself included) - please don\u2019t go to your doctor and tell them you have adhd just because this resonates with you.)"

He did the meet and greet with her: she was on a vacation with her boyfriend\u2019s family and blah..blah. The magician does his thing and then suddenly the boyfriend appears out some box that deceptively empty just a second ago. The boyfriend goes down on his knee, out comes the ring, and he goes into his declarations of love and affection and rehash the last few years \u2026 it was a sweet proposal. \n\nShe smiles and clasps her hands in front of her face and says \u2026.. absolutely nothing. We in the audience are all silent and waiting to cheer and applaud\u2026 but waiting for her to say yes. \n\nIt seemed like an eternity, but then the magician burst out with applause, he quickly guided the happy couple off the stage and announced \u201cShe said yes!\u201d  So we all cheered for the happy couple.  What else was he going to do?\n\nThey had great seats at a table, center stage and down in the front. Where we could see the happy couple and family. The poor girl sat by herself and the dude huddled with his parents at the other side. I don\u2019t think they talked at all the rest of the show.",

Of course there were tears and we both called family members and then continued on our planned holiday. We had such a good time on our holidays and were able to enjoy each other's company like normal. So I figured that if we can handle this bump in the road this well, we are a great team and at the end of the holiday I told him I would love to marry him.

      "2020 doesn't have the monopoly on \"bad years\".\n\nremember when 2019 was a bad year?\n\nAnd 18?\n\nAnd 17?\n\nIs this a very strange year in human history? Absolutely. Is it magnified by the fact it's an election year (at least in America, but everyone seems to be watching)? No doubt. Have we seen worse years in human history? That's a huge and undisputed yes. \n\nThis decade will have it's fair share of ups and downs, deaths that hit hard, years that hurt your soul and take away pinnacles of your childhood memories. The only way that doesn't happen is if your life is the one that ends during the timeframe, and then what's to worry about.\n\nTelevision and social media has a tendency to have us not see past the moment you're in as if it will last forever. \"This too shall pass\", both good and bad, and we'll make it out on the other end. If not, there's still nothing to worry about because it'll all be over anyway. \n\nSurvive and thrive or surrender and die, at the end it's up to your choices and a bit of luck, and I wish you the best of both."

      "During some in-depth discussion on the *Lord of the Rings* lore, the conversation turned somewhere deep in the appendices, or in some additional notes of Tolkien's, to the future of Middle Earth, specifically of the Hobbits, hundreds of years after Elessar's reign. He, as you may remember, designates the Shire a protected area that men cannot enter.\n\nAs time passes, these rules are gradually forgotten. The men harass the Hobbits, forcing them to become more secretive and reclusive. Their culture suffers; they forget their music and books, their cookery and their stories, and become 'like animals', 'hunted by cruel men for sport'. The passage ended with the notion that Hobbitkind had not been seen more many years, though there was a chance they could be deep in hiding, or that they had forgotten what they were.\n\nIt was depressing as fuck, but this discussion took place online in about 2009-2010 and I haven't, since, been able to find the source. I recall wanting a source and being given one, and I followed the links and confirmed it myself, reading the depressing passages although not committing the exact text to memory - was it a LOTR appendix? A separate letter detailing the Hobbits' sad future? Could even have been Chris Tolkien's musings, I honestly don't know. I have wanted to refer back to it in the years since, but as I say, I can't find it. The only line I remember with clarity was the 'hunted by cruel men for sport'.",

He started out by having sex with all the cute girls in his school, and then when he got bored of that he made his mother into his own personal sex slave, and then when he got bored of that he turned his cat into a sort of neko-catgirl-anthro thing and had sex with her. The story took a more bisexual turn after a while, and he ended up with (at various points) his hot neighbour and a harem of boys from school. So far, so normal-ish.\n\nEventually, I can only assume because the writer ran out of ideas, he started conjuring up fictional characters to bone, starting with -- and I promise you, this is as true as I remember it -- Count Chocula. Cue long descriptions about the Count\u2019s long, pale fingers all over his body, and even though the boy isn\u2019t into it to start with, eventually he concedes, drops to his knees and begins to suck cock like a pro.\n\nSpoilers: yes, it tastes like chocolate.\n\nNo matter what I try, I can\u2019t track it down, and it\u2019s slowly driving me insane. It was at least fifty thousand words long, and surprisingly well-written given just how fuckin\u2019 mental it ended up being. There were a couple of chapters that followed, but I never managed to find it again. At this point I'm considering writing it up myself just so I can preserve it in some form or other."

There were these floating platforms and bioluminescent plants everywhere, and I had just found what looked like an ancient library when my alarm went off.

This one girl on the cruise that we all universally hated (for reasons I can't remember) received a really random and useless mutation - she grew a really fat lizard tail, like a leopard gecko who has eaten a lot lol. She was crying about how ugly she was now and all we could do was laugh. Then I woke up.",

      "There are 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles due to motor vehicles in the US. What we want to know is the average distance you have to cover when you get in the car before you achieve a 1 in 5 million chance of dying.\n\nThe odds of dying while driving isn't linear. For example, if you drive 80000000 miles, that would look like you have a 100% chance of dying and at 160000000 miles you have a 200% chance of dying. That is obviously wrong. What we want is a probability distribution that gives you a cumulative probability of dying of 0% at 0 miles and 100% as you approach infinity miles.\n\nWhat we need is a ~~Poisson~~ Exponential Distribution. Exponential distributions work over continuous scales instead of discrete scales. This distribution follows the format:\n\n* Pm(x) = 1-e^(-x\\*k)\n\nWhere,\n\n* Pm is the probability of dying per commute.\n* x is the distance traveled per commute\n* and k is the probability of dying every mile. (12.5 deaths / 100000000 miles)\n\nSo, after 50 miles, your probability of dying is:\n\n* Pm(50) = 1-e^(-50\\*12.5/1000000000)=0.000000625\n* or a 1 in 1600000 chance of dying\n\nThe probability of dying from the teleporter is a constant:\n\n* Pt(x) = 1 death / 5000000 commutes\n\nAs you can see it is independent from the distance driven. What we need to know is where the two proabilities are equal:\n\n* Pm(x) =Pt(x)\n* 1-e^(-x\\*k)=Pt(x)\n* 1-Pt(x)=e^(-x\\*k)\n* ln(1-Pt(x)) = -x\\*k\n* \\-ln(1-Pt(x))/k = x\n* x = 16.0000016 miles\n\nYou need to drive just over 16 miles before the teleporter becomes safer. Interestingly enough, the answer I got when I interpreted this as a linear distribution was 16 deaths per mile. So for small improbable values, you can interpret the distribution linearly.\n\nEDIT: There's something wrong with my method. It assumes the probability of dying is linear. That means if you drive 80 million miles you will die. Standby...I'm going to fix this.\n\nSecond Edit: Okay. I've got a proper distribution now.\n\nThird Edit: You have a 50/50 chance of dying after 55.45 million miles. It isn't relevant to the teleporter question. I just thought you would like to know.\n\nFourth edit: It is an Exponential not Poisson distribution\n\nFifth edit: Fixed the spelling of discrete"

He was incredibly malnourished and thin.\n\nWe had a front door that was double door paned glass.  I always exited through the side door and would look in through the glass doors every day when I left for home.\n\nOn Sticks's second day, I looked in through the glass at the dark reception area and saw one of the office chairs behind the reception counter as it slowly spinned.\n\nI entered back in through the side door and came into the the back of reception.\n\nI found Sticks laying on the floor with an ergonomic office chair that had fallen on top of him. His head was bleeding from where he struck the floor or some other object. Also, in my peripheral vision,  I saw a can of compressed air (the type for cleaning keyboards).\n\nSticks said he was perfectly fine. I helped him up and sent him home.\n\nOver the next few days, other admin folks reported to me that they kept finding Sticks collapsed in the reception area when no one had been around.  I finally called his corporate supervisor to come take him away.  When the supervisor arrived, Sticks had locked himself in the supply closet and refused to talk to me.  I could hear him huffing air behind the door.

But on the frontlines though, most people are very supportive and friendly of each other, and you'll basically get all the help you need should you just speak up. \n\nIDK if international media reported much on the two incidents where the police basically blocked in two universities, fired a crazy amount of tear gas and arrested a lot of protestors but after that, a major issue that kinda popped up were that with a lot of more experienced frontline protestors arrested or under bail, the less experienced had to step up. What happened was that in the following protests, people were definitely less organized and aware of what to do; many times we've seen people just provoking the police and not running away in time, or just occupying a spot until a lot of people just get arrested.\n\nAfter the breakout of the Wuhan virus, there's been a lot less protests, but similar events still garner a lot of attention from protestors and a lot of us show up to these events, such as monthly gatherings on the 31st to Prince Edward station due to the incident where police basically entered the station and a train and used a lot of unnecessary force on citizens last August 31st, or holding vigils for those who have fallen from the protests.\n\nPsychologically though, I think all protestors, frontline or not, are mentally exhausted. Our government manages to go lower with each policy they make, and police brutality just gets worse every day while there power remains unchecked. I'd go as far to say that we are really desperate, but we're still not giving in.\n\nThanks for asking, it means a lot that internationally, people still care about us!",

I even started leading the conversation into the middle of the street hoping a passing car would seperate us. None if it worked. We only finally made it out of there because it got dark.\n\nI've decided the next time this happens I'm just going to tell her politely, but firmly, that I need to take a dump and then just walk away.\n\nEdit:the replies to this are hilarious. I tried every single one of these things. I have no explanation why it took so long to finally end the convo.",
      "I think maybe they're not so much intrusive just trying to spark a conversation. I would stop what you're doing, give them 5 minutes of undivided attention, you don't have to reveal too much, just get to know each other, then wrap it up with an \"alright good to see you, I gotta get back to this\".",
      "Some of the responses you've gotten don't seem to understand that there are just people like this, that don't respect personal boundaries and can't pick up on subtle hints like one word answers.\n\nThe way I deal with these people is by humoring them for a bit, using some of the tactics already mentioned (giving short, uninterested answers). If they don't catch the hints I'm dropping, I'll pretend to have something else to do. Go inside.\n\nThe premise of this question is why the phrase \"Good fences make good neighbors\" exists. Try to make your boundaries clear, and, barring that, build a tall fence so they can't see/bother you.",

      "Imagine, for the moment, that the universe began in a truly colossal flash of light.\n\nFor the first several eons, there was little more than dust, slowly being drawn together by a combination of gravity and electromagnetism. Then, as stars formed and gave birth to planets, and as complex molecules came together, the beginnings of life emerged.\n\nAt first, this life was incredibly simple; barely capable of surviving to reproduce, let alone contemplating its own existence. As the ages passed, though, it gave rise to more and more complexity, eventually resulting in beings who could look up at the stars that had birthed them and wonder: \"Why?\" These creatures, driven by something they could scarcely comprehend, set about trying to define their place in world and explain how they came to inhabit it.\n\nThey began to believe.\n\nLike the organisms that had spawned them, these beliefs and suppositions grew and evolved. They incited terrible tragedies and sparked incredible developments, until the day that they finally fell away and were replaced by an ever-increasing awareness of the cosmos. However, the original drive \u2013 the desire to know and understand \u2013 remained, and it prompted the thinking creatures to combine their efforts in pursuit of an answer.\n\nThe inquisitive explorers reached toward the stars once more... and when they did, they encountered other beings, not terribly unlike themselves. There were rough patches in these meetings, of course, but as each species learned to understand and cherish one another, they all compounded their perspectives in pursuit of their goal. A single, interlinked mind rose from the trillions of individual beings, just as their individuals brains had risen from tiny connected cells.\n\nIt took millenia, but the entity \u2013 having come to include every creature in the universe \u2013 finally found the answer that it sought... and yet, it was not wholly content. Through its expansive consciousness and unfathomable technology, it was able to know everything that ever was, wasn't, or would be. It could control the whole of existence with little more than a passing thought... and as it contemplated, it realized what it actually wanted.\n\nSpace began to shrink in upon itself. Stars and planets were swept up in an invisible wake, being pulled inward at impossible speeds and across countless lightyears. It took eons more, but finally, all of the possibilities and all of the many celestial bodies were brought together in a single point, both infinitely dense and incalculably massive, yet persisting at a size seemingly too small to exist. Tiny adjustments were made and minute (but important) rules were put into place... but ultimately, the end result of the entity's influences would remain unknown.\n\nThen, there was a colossal flash of light.\n\nPlanets formed. Life arose. Creatures scurried through the world. Battles were fought, love was found, and an entire history was written across an infinite number of unique minds.\n\nSome of those minds delighted in sharing their stories, while others wanted nothing more than to hear them.\n\nRemember to listen.\n\n**TL;DR: We are the universe entertaining itself.**",
      "That it even exists at all. Like, why is there something instead of nothing? Blows my mind.\n",
      "\u201cTwo possibilities exist: either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.\u201d\n\n-Arthur C. Clarke",

We're made of each and every atom that the universe is comprised of.\n\nIt sounds super philosophical and like something a stoned person would say, but the distinctiness within our universe is what sets everyone apart. The way each of us, made up of the same elements of this universe, yet manage to be so different. Perhaps you could say the greatest and rather miraculous thing of all is in-fact, life."

    "comments": [
      "We got screwed once in a Taco Bell drive thru (not the usual way), which sent my mom into a complete meltdown. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe people running the place had - I shit you not - run out of lettuce.  And I've never dealt with dumber people.  Instead of just... telling people they were out and letting it go, they were being idiots and saying \"There'll be a small delay...\" \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was a super hot day, the AC was broke, we're exhausted, all we *really* want is some water, but we're stuck in the drive thru line waiting and waiting as ... they try to figure out how to make lettuce out of thin air? You'd think there'd be another bag somewhere or something but... maybe that was too complicated for them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo - twenty minutes into sitting cooking in the car trapped between other cars in the drive through and unable to go forward or back or even sideways ( speaker and signs, even if we wanted to jump the curb) and my mother is just cursing up a blue streak about the stupidity of the people involved, screaming her damn head off about 'just fucking make some lettuce free tacos you dumb shits, what do you use for brains, the fettid remains of your blasted out assholes' - I remember much of this very vividly as I was about 12 or 13 at the time, and I was learning all sorts of new words and phrases.  My little brother took notes. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's when we see some taco bell teenage idiot employee boy make a break from the building and go sprinting across the parking lot over towards the grocery store across the way.  *They sent out a fuckhead to go buy some lettuce...* \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe cursing rises a few notches.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE FUCKING LETTUCE.  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST JUST LET US OUT OF HERE YOU LITTLE ... etc etc etc.  Volume. Variety. Viciousness.  Mom hits all the good Vs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nForty five minutes or so after we got into this - the car at the window (a couple ahead of us), which is probably the real villain of the story (why wouldn't they fucking leave without lettuce? Wtf?) finally gets handed something ... and they don't leave immediately they have to fucking talk for a while before they drive off.  \n\nMy mom is a volcano past it's sell by date and just frothing at the mouth now, but *eventually* ... they pull off and leave and we can pull up to the window. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat I've left out of this story is... my family, for a few years, would participate in parades as clowns, handing out candy to the kids at the side of the road and dancing our way through the parade route to the rocking tune of \"Cel-e-brate good time To-Night!\" on repeat.\n\nAnd this day was one of those days - we were all in full costume.  Makeup, super baggy rainbow pants, rainbow wig, big flower on the suspenders, big ole ridiculous shoes... the whole deal. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo the car finally pulls away ahead of us, and my mom, who for the last hour has been a spitting bulldog of bile and vindictive rage and a constant criticizer of the drive thru window people's ancestry and breeding... realizes she has to pull up and face them in full Clown Regalia to get our stupid tacos. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI remember that moment when Mom realized it.  The mix of anger, embarrassment, ridiculousness of it - and eventually the humor of the whole situation - went through her and she started laughing so hard she was crying. \n\nAnd when the people behind us started honking for us to just GO (they'd been waiting too) - it just got funnier somehow.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now mom is not just a crazy angry lady - she's a Crazy Angry Clown Lady, and more than that - she's a crazy clown lady who's been sweating and now crying too.   So she's not even a crazy clown lady with good makeup anymore, she's just a wreck of a crazy clown lady. \n\nWhich makes her laugh even harder. \n\nMy brother and I thought she was going to die.  I mean, she couldn't breathe, and those outfits, the heat, hell - the whole reason we pulled into this place was we needed water...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo give mom credit, she didn't just squeal out of there flipping everyone the bird - she got herself together, pulled up to the window, looked up at the girl through the car window with her ruined clown make up and big rainbow wig, and handed her the money very calmly, said thank you and took the bag, and we drove off. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope to hell they remember us.  I know I'll never forget the look on the drive thru girl's face as we drove up and she started to try to apologize for the delay and... just ... stopped.  Staring at us. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nGood day.",

Escalated to the floor manager and the store manager.\n\nMeanwhile, I didn't want the pants.  They were ok pants I guess, nothing awesome, I just didn't care very much about them.  I was more than happy to move on.  I told my dad I didn't want the pants, by then he didn't care about what I wanted, he wanted the pants at the better price.\n\nEventually after like an hour of arguing the store manager said \"we're not giving you the pants at that price.  Take them or leave them at $40\".  So we left them.  Which suited me just fine, because I didn't want the pants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

It's 99% from the City of Chattanooga (or maybe Lookout Mountain)  municipal water supply.  \n\nOf course, with such a wet area, old electrical wires going back to the Great Depression, and 300 feet underground, it sputters, or shorts out and stops every now and then.

      "Just  a normal Saturday night, I was watching TV home alone with my 2 dogs,  when I heard a banging sound coming from the basement. Legit sounded  like somebody was just banging something on the appliances we had down  there.\n\nNow there is no access into  the basement from down there, only through the upstairs rooms that I  was in and knew nobody could have come in and got past me.\n\nSo with this knowledge I was not as scared as you may think, more curious as to what the heck the noise was.\n\nOne  of the two dogs who is a meathead and wants to fight everybody also  heard the noise and was now bolting down into the basement to  investigate.\n\nI get down and see  that it is my other dog, banging his head into our dryer and chest  freezer which are next to each other. My meathead dog is just stood  there watching confused. So I approach my other dog and calm him down  and we all go back upstairs. Now this freaked the heck out of me and  upset me as it seems such very strange behaviour for my dog to do.\n\nFast-forward  only 30mins or so, the banging starts again. I instantly look over to  my dog, but he is lay down, but now also aware of the noise downstairs.  We run down into the basement and it is meathead now banging his head in  between the appliances. Again, I now calm meathead down and we all go  back upstairs .\n\nNothing has ever  happened again since that night, 3 years now - so that ruled out brain  tumors which is what I read on line about why maybe dogs bang their  heads ( but 2 dogs, suddenly on the same night,and it only effecting 1 of them at any given time)\n\n3 years and the 3 of us never talk about that night lol.\n\n**Edit:** Wow thanks for all the awards and updoots. To answer a few questions, yes I have posted this story before - I have a very normal life and this story is just wayyyy out there but legit truthful to my otherwise mundane life.\n\nA few folk say it may have been a rodent/treat /toy they were after - No, they were frenzied and hyperventilating, when they get things stuck under anything they just cry and get me to get their stuff.\n\nI guess it boils down to just knowing your dogs,I know instantly from their body language,just what the deal is - but that night,I have never seen them so frenzied and upset.\n\nAlso,it is otherwise a very nice basement ( as basements go ),I have never had a pest problem down there or in any other part of the house.\n\nSomebody mentioned that if it only happened 3 years ago,why did I not make a video of it ? - My first instinct was to help my dogs to stop them harming themselves - at no point was my first thought to go and grab my phone to capture the moments on film.Really surprised I have to mention that one..........but people/keyboards/warriors."

All you could see were tiny feet and arms sticking out from under her like a Loony-Tunes cartoon. Then Bridesmaid rolled onto her back while the bride helped the Flower Girl (who was now sobbing) up off the floor.

Very Fundie Christian. At the reception, the FOB stands up and gives a speech about how when the Bride was 12 he gave her a True Love Waits ring as a pledge to him that she would keep herself \u201csexually pure\u201d (his actual words) until \u201cher Prince Charming\u201d came along. She wore that ring every day and he (the FOB) checked in with her often to make sure she kept her promise. He then took the ring from the Bride and gave it to the Groom as a gesture that the FOB was presenting the Bride, \u201cpure and unspotted to the care and authority of her new husband.\u201d The Bride sat there beaming while everyone at my table cringed SO HARD.

At a Golden Corral. Then the reception was at.... the same Golden Corral. Then we had a hockey game that night. The other team we played that night somehow found out about it and hounded the guy the whole time. They were a bunch of dicks.\n\nNow about 7 years later that have a second kid, dad is an officer in the Air Force, both of his kids play hockey and he coaches and refs and him and his wife look very happy so I\u2019m glad it all worked out for them.\n\nEdit: For all of you asking about the game, I honestly don\u2019t remember if we won. Hockey seasons a long one with a lot of games and it was 7-8 years ago.\n\nAnd as a side note I really did not mean for this to be a rip on the couple. They\u2019re amazing together and doing an awesome job raising their kids in a loving household where they want for nothing. They haven\u2019t had the easiest lives but they\u2019re doing the best they can and absolutely killing it\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to him in a while but I\u2019ve seen his dad (our old coach) at alumni games and they\u2019re such an awesome family.

The government, immediately backed up by lots of celebrities, is basically saying \"please, stay home\". Our emergency departments in the hospitals are collapsing. Literally, chemos or surgeries that are \"not urgent\" are being delayed (how's a chemo not urgent?). \nBars and restaurants can only open from 6 am to 6 pm. It's been over a month that places where big number of people could meet have been closed (discos, sport centers, clubs, schools and universities). It's crazy.",

      "I live in the heart of the Lombardy region. All my family has it and my grand uncle died. People just stay home and that\u2019s it. There is not much to do and shops are closed. \n\nYou can hear ambulances all day and night.\n\nMy uncle is in the hospital with a high fever. His wife got it as well but she is home as her symptoms are milder. My cousin is taking care of her and miraculously she is fine.\n\nHowever her grandpa died and she couldn\u2019t even go to visit him. Her grandma is sick as well and she can\u2019t see her either and she can\u2019t see her dad. Hospitals are closed.\n\nThe available hospital beds in intensive care have run out and doctors are making tough choices for who to try to save which is terrifying considering most of my family is old and they might not get a bed. \n\nDoctors are overworked and tired and since I know many people that work in the hospital, they are sharing with me these gruesome pics of people recovered in the intensive care unit. They are intubated and it just is a sad view.\n\n\nHospitals are so full of people on life support because of Coronavirus people are amassed on the corridors because they lack rooms:\n\nMy friend who gets people with the ambulance is working non stop to get people who are in critical\n conditions.\n\n\nPeople keep saying it\u2019s just a flu. Yes sure, but a flu without having had a vaccine can be quite dangerous. The youngest person I know that has it, he is in his forties and has had 40 degrees Celsius temperature for two weeks straight and counting. \n\nDon\u2019t catch it, it\u2019s really not fun even if your immune system is strong, trust me on this, I have seen the repercussion on my family first hand. \n\nNo church is open or public event is held. \n\nSince Italy is primarily populated by old people, we are used to see the streets being empty and everything being quite. Right now is just quieter.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t even held the funeral for her grandpa.\n\nMy grandma woke up sick and I truly hope she has something else.\n\nSo many people in my city have it and yet they keep going around the city and spreading it. Incredible. \n\nSome people  go to the supermarket and get out of it with tons of food so that they don\u2019t need to go shopping again. Others, like my grandma, go everyday because \u201chow else is she going to get fresh bread?\u201d\nLuckily we have convinced her that she cannot go anymore and she said from tomorrow she won\u2019t leave the house. Just this Sunday she HAD to go to church to confess. The town priest has been taken to the hospital today because he catched Coronavirus and he is in critical conditions.\n\nI wonder how this death count will go up now that the hospitals are overfilled.\n\nRumor has it that my cousin\u2019s grandma got it because she was in the hospital being treated because she broke her back but I can\u2019t be sure about this so this is just our personal speculation based on no real evidence so don\u2019t take my word for it. \n\n\n\nEdit: first cases of people younger than 25 in life support",

I got an X-ray done anyway and the radiologist confirmed every one of my suspicions, but the pediatrician still said to wait and see because that\u2019s what you do with dermoid cysts and it was definitely not through the skull despite what the radiologist said. Made an appointment at the hospital anyway, and the surgeon swore up and down that although it was a dermoid cyst as I\u2019d suspected, it would not be through the skull since in all his years of practice it never had been. Well guess what? It WAS through the skull, and it was pressing on the membrane between the skull and the brain, a hair\u2019s breadth from breaking the membrane or pressing on the brain.

      "My first boyfriend- I was barely 15, he was 21. Worked in a local shop and all the girls at my school liked him so came as a bit of a surprise when the biggest dork ever (me) somehow landed him and not any of the popular girls.\n\nWe dated for maybe 4 months, turned out he was sleeping with 3 girls in my year which I found confusing because I\u2019d begged him to take my virginity to no avail. Always found that really weird and insulting that he never even wanted to sleep with me.\n\nPlot twist: my mum had stormed into the shop when we first started dating and told him, \u2018if you take my daughter\u2019s virginity, I will kill you with my bare hands.\u2019 \n\nGod bless my mum.",
      "He was my guidance counselor. I didn't realize how creepy he was until he proposed. The whole thing was fucked.",
      "I was 16 when I started seeing a 24-year-old friend of my mom. At the time it felt flattering\u2014he called me \u201cmature,\u201d took me to bars, showered me with gifts. He\u2019d guilt-trip me if I tried to back out or hang with friends. I thought I was special until years later in therapy she pointed out all the grooming signs. Realized I\u2019d been manipulated and that an adult crossing those lines was never okay.",
      "I was 14 and dated a 25 year old cop. He never asked my age and I never told. One day were chatting on phone and I told him that I got some homework to do and I'll call back later. He said freshmen year of college getting to ya huh? I said, college? I'm in high school. Dead silence, then he asked how old I was and I said 14. He freaked out and was saying I'm gonna go to jail for this and I'm gonna lose my job. He said I can't see you again and please don't tell anyone. I said yeah of course. I got why he was scared and I never saw him again and never told."

      "I thought of a second one. I was incredibly sheltered growing up. Anything sex-related was taboo and not discussed.\n\nI was in middle school when instant messaging really became mainstream. I couldn\u2019t understand why the boy I had a crush on kept laughing at me and telling me not to use the shorthand \u201ccum\u201d for \u201ccome.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t find out for a few years.\n\nRelated: I genuinely thought a hand job was essentially frantically waving side to side with the palm on the penis and a blow job was - you guessed it - blowing on a penis until probably around 8th grade?\n\n*sigh*",
      "Caulk guns. Everyone says that you're supposed to pull it towards you, but I saw a reddit comment saying that they're designed to be pushed away instead. My boss looks at me funny for doing it, but it's exponentially cleaner and tighter!\n\nEdit: quite a few of y'all are mentioning that you're unclear on what you're pushing away. When you caulk you slide the entire gun across the crack that you're sealing, so it's that. You can only ever slide it towards you or away from you (unless you're going sideways, I guess) and most people pull the entire gun and tip towards them whereas sliding it in the other direction works too. A few of y'all sound like you know exactly what you're doing and have added a couple other tips on how to do it cleaner and better, too, so thanks for that.",

      "My SO and I were in a fight and he said \"You are unbelievably selfish and impossible to talk to\". Somehow my defense mechanisms were not engaged at that moment because I *heard* him and realized it was true. I saw for the first time that I had been (mostly) an asshole all my life - that is - super defensive and wrong about a lot of things (aka a \"narcissist\"). I have since had to *learn* how to be kind, to listen, to give back and while it has been very hard (I still cringe often when I think back on many moments in my life) I now know *I* was wrong, my life is so much better. \n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the upvotes, the silver and the gold. For those of you who suffer from the same affliction and want to make a change or two I highly recommend daily meditation and reading the stoics and/or checking out The School of Life .com (a brilliant \"how to\" guide for living a better life).
