Now we\u2019re a running joke.  \n- Inflation is up not down, thanks entirely to his unforced errors.  \n- We risk losing reserve currency status, a potentially permanent disaster most Americans are too ignorant to understand.  \n- He\u2019s even killing the bond markets.

Her parents were away to help a set of grandparents move into assisted living, and when they got back the front door was open. They were instantly worried about her and their 3 cats.

They were emailing each other pics and movies, storing them on the server they had. As soon as management knew, they fired the team and locked all their devices in a secure room.\n\n\nMy friend's job was to go through all of it. All the workstations, server, and email accounts, creating a spreadsheet of the content. This was per the legal department, to make sure there was nothing illegal there. It took him over a week to get it done, to keep it quiet and tell no one from the company other than the lawyers. Fortunately, there was nothing illegal, just... really graphic.

      "My dad had serious heart problems starting at an early age. It\u2019s hereditary. I had my bypass surgery 10 years ago. Anyhow, my mom and dad were at a CVS waiting for prescriptions. My dad, as usual, tested his blood pressure there. My mom said what the hell - it\u2019s free, so she tried it out. Her blood pressure was sky high. After talking to the pharmacist thinking something was wrong with the machine and testing again a few more times, he urged her to follow up with her doctor. She did. After a bunch of testing, they discovered she had Stage 4 small cell lung cancer. She had no idea. I went to the oncologist appointment where he told her there was about 5% chance of making it 5 years. It\u2019s super hard to treat small cell lung cancer because you need to kill 100% of the cancer cells. 99.999% is not good enough. \n\nShe lived about another 20 years and died of normal old age crap. She beat it somehow. Lesson learned - never give up. Like Jim Carey said in that move - yes - there is a chance.",
      "So I don't know if I have it yet, blood cancers take a while to screen for properly. What triggered the screening is I regularly donate blood and plasma, and of course they test it for dangerous shit before using it. Well I'd given plasma, waited the 2 weeks, and went to book myself in right on time. The app said I wasn't eligible to donate anything, tried the website, same deal. Weird. \n\nWell I call up to see what's what, lady on the phone takes a look at my file and says she's transferring me to the health team. They say they're mailing me a letter I need to take to my doc because some of the values were off. Red blood cell count under standard range, white blood very under standard range. Go to my doc, have to get another test done, I'd managed to keep red level by eating a fuckload of red meat for 2 weeks (spiked my iron though), white has dropped even further. Next test holds level. One more to go and if it's not back up I'm probably getting a bone marrow biopsy to test for leukemia.\n\n  \nThe thing that really got me worried though was after the first test with my GP getting worse I had to explain to him that I've had a lot of CT scans in my life, starting at 10 years old and had had like 6+ since the start of covid, as well as other exposure to hazardous radiation, and worked with a lot of carcinogenic chemicals at uni, often being a bit blase about my PPE. He needed to consider me higher risk than an average person.\n\n  \nOne thing I will say is this. Nobody tells you just how bad the waiting is. Have to wait a month for more bloodwork, doc is booked up so have to wait a week to see him and I can't see the results until then. It puts a real emotional drain on you, and there have been multiple times I've been on evening walks and get in my head about \"what do I tell my family?\", I live alone so how much support will I actually get if I need chemo? Do I even tell my friends? I certainly can't tell the one that's pregnant and add more stress. There's a wedding coming up, how well will I be equipped to even go? Just wandering dark streets lightly crying and freaking out behind my glasses. The waiting man. Think of like, a really stressful exam you've had, not sure if you'll pass or fail. How worried you were waiting for the results. Now multiply it to a level of \"this may actually kill me.\"",

      "I got a dog here. If I didn't come home one day, he'd never stop sitting by the door waiting for me. He'd never stop missing my smell and my voice. He'd never stop wishing for one more walk, one more game of chasing the laser with me, one more high-five for a treat. He'd never stop jumping to peek out the window when he heard somebody coming up the sidewalk, and letting his heart be filled with a moment's joyful hope. No matter how many times that hope was dashed, he'd never let go of it. He's kind of a doofus that way.\n\nAnybody else in my life might eventually get over it. You can explain to them what happened and they'd at least be able to understand if not accept it. But my little brown dog would sit forever wondering why I didn't come home. And he's had a hard enough life so far. I was his only friend when he had nobody, and he was mine.\n\nNo matter what I'm going through in life, putting him through that sort of suffering is not something my soul would ever let me do. Otherwise, I probably would have done it already. \n\nLife is random. There's no fate. There's no karma. \"The Secret\" doesn't actually work, except for making the people who wrote those books rich. There's no magic Santa Claus in the sky making sure all the good people are blessed and the bad people are punished. Maybe God exists, but he sure doesn't interfere. I've been praying for decades for some sort of help, or at least guidance so I can help myself. No response. No answers either. For example, why did a loving God let such an abusive monster come into my mom's life when I was a kid, turning me into an emotional cripple who can't deal with any sort of stress without crumbling? Why does child abuse happen every single day in this world? No response.\n\nSo a sane person can only conclude that it's all just random. \n\nThat can be scary. But it can also be liberating. It means that the sheer law of averages will save your ass at some point. It can't all be bad forever. That breaks the laws of the universe. At some point something randomly good will happen. The scales will eventually balance. There's no intelligence behind it. It's just chaos that's part good and part bad. Accept it. Fighting it won't change anything.\n\nOne thing's for sure, though. Those who are prepared for the random things that come their way will have a better time dealing with them. Sit exactly on the middle line between optimism and pessimism. Prepare for emergencies so that they don't destroy you, and enjoy the good things to the fullest when they do come. But overall, just wait and watch, knowing and accepting that nothing can be good forever, but neither can anything be bad forever. ",

      "My brother committed suicide when I was 8. He was 15. My dad has been abusive but my brother suffered the most from him. He was my hero. I looked up to him and wanted to be like him. He\u2019d take the fall for me when I did something that would cause my dad to punish me. I remember that morning vividly. I got back from school the previous day and went to go hang out with him in his room but his door was locked. I kept coming back but he wouldn\u2019t answer the door. My parents weren\u2019t worried because my brother usually kept to himself like that. When it was time for bed I told my dad to see if he could get the door open and he told me not to bother my brother again. After my brother didn\u2019t come down for breakfast my father broke his door and we found him hanging from the ceiling. I wish I didn\u2019t see that. I screamed the entire time and wouldn\u2019t left go of his hand. It felt cold and my mother had to peel me away. He left a suicide note and a hand written will. He left me his favourite book. I miss you Jeff. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone for the love. \n\nEdit 2: My dad kept repeating \u201cwhy Jeffery? Why? and tried to get him down from the fan. I was screaming PLEASE JEFF! and pulling his hand and when my mom couldn\u2019t separate our hands she pulled me away. She was crying so hard. I remember kicking my legs in the air and screaming \u201cyou should have opened his door for me\u201d\n\nEdit 3: The book is Animal farm by George Orwell. I always carry it with me now. Whenever he\u2019d read it to me I\u2019d make fun of how the big words sounded funny and we\u2019d laugh. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much in his will. He left me the book and his game boy. He left my mom his wrist watch. My dad didn\u2019t get anything in the will. \n\nEdit 4: Wow I woke up to a ton of supportive messages and so much love. Thank you for all your kind words. I\u2019ve never spoken about the details before and I pray this helps someone who is struggling. To all the Jeff\u2019s, I know it\u2019s hard but please be strong. You don\u2019t want to have your family calling your name and you not answering. It\u2019s the most painful thing ever. For years I had nightmares of trying to save him but each time I\u2019d get there too late. \n\nIn his note he said he was really sorry and didn\u2019t mean to hurt any of us but he just couldn\u2019t bear the pain anymore. He said he hoped it would make my dad stop being disappointed in him and called me his best bud in the world. He told my mom he loved her and hoped she\u2019d find the courage he didn\u2019t have. \n\nThanks to all the gold x 4!",

Volunteering, charity work, etc is more aimed at helping x, while you benefit in socializing. \n\nMy anecdote, others may vary. \nThe other fishing, hunting, etc group's come from making connections. Door knocking, leaving letter etc asking for permission and slowly building a blue book of properties to hunt n fish while cleaning up there property in return. Plus you can ask if they want me to take anyone in their family with me or can I bring a person over etc after trust is built. \n\nLastly, if anyone reads my handle. It's okay to be alone. I'm alone but not lonely. I have reddit to come socialize with you assholes :). But fr it's okay to only have a hand few friends you connect with. The key aspect of friendship is respect.

They aren't your friend.\n\nEdit: the yt channel isn't seek discomfort (that's there catch phrase) it is \"Yes Theory\" without the quotations. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/c/YesTheory"

    "comments": [
      "I'm an ER doctor, and sometimes I have other doctors as patients.\n\nFor the most part they're pretty good patients because they can give a good description of their symptoms in a way that's useful the me.  They usually ask good questions and are well equipped to have an informed discussion about their diagnosis and treatment.  Sometimes it's hard for me to dial back my \"patient talk\" where I simplify medical terms for laypeople.  Sometimes it's challenging if their area of expertise is totally unrelated to the issue at hand and they don't recognize their limited understanding.\n\nThe worst patients are those who have just a little medical knowledge and think they know everything.  Some version of: \"My aunt is a nurse, and she said a need a whole body MRI for this runny nose...\"\n\nAs far as self diagnosing, I usually deal with my own minor medical issues.  If I noticed signs of something more serious, I would go to someone else.",
      "My mom is a nurse and never tells the doctors what she does for a living. It's so they'll speak to her not as a nurse but as a patient. Even though she can understand what they're saying when they use their medical jargon she doesn't want them to be overly comfortable using the jargon while treating her.",
      "It's kinda weird, tbh. I definitely try not to diagnose myself beforehand. Like, I'll have a symptom, but I actively avoid the WebMD spiral. Then, during the appointment, I try to just present the facts without trying to lead the doc to a conclusion. It's hard! There's this urge to be like, \"Yeah, I've been researching this, and I think it might be...\" but I know that's just annoying. They usually appreciate a clear, concise history. And yeah, sometimes there's a little \"insider baseball\" talk if it's something interesting. We might geek out a bit over some obscure pathology. But mostly, I just try to be a good patient and not a know-it-all. Let them do their job, y'know?\n",
      "Doctor here (family medicine). I self diagnose most things, but for my 1 year old daughter I decided a while ago that I don't want to do that for her. So her pediatrician doesn't know I'm a doctor - I never told her. I want her to treat me like any other parent, and explain everything to me like I'm 5 years old. I'm afraid of of being too nonchalant with my daughter's health that I'll miss something (or the doctor assuming I know more than I really do). \n\nIt's actually a strategy I've adopted since on myself- if I go to a doctor (say a gynecologist for a routine check up) I sometimes just don't say what I do so I can legitimacy ask dumb questions about things that I should really know- or so that the other doctor won't leave out important info that they assume I know for fear of insulting me. \n\nOn the other hand, my regular doctors do know, such as the gynecologist who saw me through my pregnancies, and that enables more complex and nuanced disscusions about health decisions- as in debating questions and giving me options that he wouldn't necessarily do with it he patients, bc he can be sure I understand the medical pros and cons well once I'm given a basic explanation."

So not only was it hot out and we\u2019re all in tuxes serving a shit-ton of people, the family of the bride who are funding this affair are some of the rudest and most-demanding people imaginable, so it was not the most fun gig in general. \n\nWell, one of the aunts on the bride\u2019s turned out to be the rudest of the bunch and kept trying to pull the \u201cI\u2019m related to the bride so give me give me give me\u201d-act (even though she wasn\u2019t even in the fucking wedding party), and was just making the lives of any one of us who came in contact with her even more of a living hell than what we were experiencing, including the owner of the company, who was lead bartender at the main bar. \n\nNow that point is key because, by some grace of whatever higher power/force/fate/kismet or whatever you call it, I was also working that same bar, which gave me the opportunity to bear witness to the most beautifully constructed instance of comeuppance to which I had ever seen to that point, and don\u2019t expect to ever see it bettered again: the nightmare bitch aunt is in young bossman\u2019s bar line, and loudly complaining the whole time how long it\u2019s taking, and she shouldn\u2019t even have to be waiting in a line anyway because she\u2019s whatever-the-bride\u2019s name\u2019s aunt, blah-blah-blah, just making a huge stink. When she got up to the head of the line to place her order, she said something along the lines of how slow and ineffectual he was, to which he responded something along the lines of \u201cwe\u2019re going as the fast as we can, here\u2019s your drink, have a nice evening\u201d (through gritted teeth I\u2019m sure), which led her into the following diatribe: \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re nothing but a bunch of dumbass kids - don\u2019t you have any adults back there working this wedding? I want to talk to your manager or the owner or someone who\u2019s an adult who can get you out of here and get the job done right.\u201d To which a huge shit-ass-eating grin washed over his face as he replied, \u201cHi! My name (his name). I am the owner of this catering company, please note that if you would like for me to go, then this reception will have no food or beverages or bar service.\u201d \n\nI swear you could almost hear a hype crew descending from the heavens shouting \u201cOHHHHHHH!!!\u201d after he said it. It was a moment of transcendence I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever experience again. Plus, the bitchy aunt didn\u2019t bother us again the rest of the night.\n\n*edited to include paragraphs*"

    "comments": [
      "I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied \u201ctoo\u201d at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.\n\nModern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It\u2019s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It\u2019s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It\u2019s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It\u2019s enforcing laws in school that don\u2019t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is \u201cunprofessional\u201d and a \u201cdistraction\u201d to other students. It\u2019s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a \u201cdemographic\u201d without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It\u2019s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It\u2019s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what \u201cblack people\u201d are to others across the world (imagine you\u2019re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you\u2019ll assume that must be true).\n\nWhen  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at \u201cone of them tech companies\u201d. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn\u2019t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn\u2019t  have to deal with?\n\nSo please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we\u2019re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don\u2019t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don\u2019t have to pass down that generational trauma.\n\nIf you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don\u2019t hear others.\n\nEDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow!

Early education in personality psychology. There should be a course starting in 9th grade about the big 5 personality model and how your idiosyncrasies as a person contribute to your mental health. Big change when I learned about this at the age of 30.\n\n3. Stop with the patriarchy and man hating nonsense. Most men are not in the 1%. It sucks when you're told you oppress people just by existing. Like dude, I'm 500$ away from being homeless and have no friends, wtf are you even talking about.\n\n4.

The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.\n\nAnyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.\n\nAll of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard."

Nothing unites people quite like shared confusion and bizarre plot twists. Plus, it's hard to argue when everyone's too busy trying to figure out what's happening next in the hentai storyline.

So I tried this radical thing called \"hobbies and interests\" that I actually enjoy, instead of just vibing with what everyone else digs. Also, therapy helped\u2014shoutout to my therapist for untangling the mess inside my head. Now I'm just out here rediscovering the joy of being a weirdo, one TikTok dance at a time.

      "Start reading into existentialism. \n\n\nIt will help you realize we are never really THIS person or THAT person, but rather in the words of Sartre; we are always in the process of becoming.\n\n\nThis helps do away with the bad faith in \"finding myself\", which so many of us feel we need to do, when in reality we always are in that process.
