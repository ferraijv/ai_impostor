      "Imagine he is alive but in a coma on life support through the election.",
      "While it\u2019s all speculative, such an event would likely lead to immediate political chaos and increased polarization. There would probably be a massive nationwide investigation and a surge in conspiracy theories. Mike Pence would assume the presidency, but the repercussions on the political landscape, both domestically and internationally, would be unpredictable and significant. There could be increased tensions and protests, similar to what happened after his election, but on a larger scale.",
      "Had this attack succeeded, the GOP would have gnashed its teeth in public while its old guard silently breathed a sigh of relief and began reasserting control. The RNC would have moved to remove the Trump children from power, and a standard Republican candidate like Haley, Rubio or DeSantis would have emerged from the convention as the nominee. In fact my bet would be on a Haley-Rubio ticket.\u00a0\n\nIn response, the Dems would have completed their \u2018et tu Brute\u2019 coup against Biden, since the argument that he is the only one who could beat Trump would have dissolved. Kamala Harris would emerge as the candidate following a nasty backbiting Democratic Convention colored by accusations of racism and sexism. Her running mate is likely Shapiro to give the Dems Pennsylvania.\u00a0\n\nIn a very close election, Haley wins the Presidency after a hasty debate in which she clearly defeats Kamala, and America gets its first female President. Kamala would win Pennsylvania closely but lose every other Rust Belt state plus Florida and Nevada. The Trump influence fades back into the subtextual woodwork of right wing thought, as it has before after the likes of Faubus, McCarthy and Huey P. Long.\n\nAll of which is enough to give conspiracy theorists on both sides plenty of ammo to fuel their crazy theories.\u00a0\n\nThe reality is this was a symptom of America\u2019s mass shooting culture, perpetrated by the exact same archetypal young isolated white male as every other mass shooting. He will certainly have used an AR that he likely was wearing the barrel out of at the range in recent weeks. His miss by less than two inches from 130 yards will be attributed to his nerves and his pulse rate in yanking the trigger in the heat of the moment.\u00a0\n\nMotivations are likely to be scant, but there is a better than even chance he was a QAnon guy who got disturbed by Trump\u2019s association with Epstein, spurred to act out of feelings of betrayal.\u00a0",
      "To be brutally honest, I think even if you\u2019re vehemently opposed to Trump, that is worst case scenario. He would become a martyr to all the people who adore him, and they would be invigorated by their rage to group around the next guy the republicans give them to follow"

      "I have never told anyone about this before.... but back when I was 15 (1979) I stole a Datsun 240Z car in my neighborhood. I was walking home from sa friends house one hot summer night and as I walked by this cool Z car I noticed a single key sticking out of the drivers door lock.  I had always thought that that car was cool and thought it would have been bitchin to drive.. well it was!  \nSo I kinda looked around and saw no signs of life anywhere so I got in and drove it off. It was a super nice car. I drove all around the valley (Grew up in palm springs).  This car was too nice to be treated to a joy ride so after a few hours of driving it, I took it back and parked it right back in it's parking spot at about 4am.... I figured it was very unlikely that the owner would even know it had drove, other than it missing about a 1/3rd of tank of gas. But I did keep the key, because they would think the just misplaced it somewhere. And I guess thats exactly what they did because a couple of weeks later I did the same thing, only this time it was almost out of gas so I had to put some in it.  Did the 2nd time just like the first time.\n\nAbout a week later I did it again, that time I drove it up to big bear lake because I was dying to drive it on mountain roads.... it was a blast!  Until, I stopped at a little gas/market to get a snack and bumped into one of my older brothers good friend who Knew I was only 15 and didn't have drivers licence or a car, muchless a vintage sports car.  I can't remember the lies I told him but knew I was going to be in deep shit when I got home.  I hauled ass back to PS, stopped at 7/11 and filled the car with gas and snuck it back into their driveway, took a pen and scribbled out a thank you note and told them that I really loved their car  and they really shouldn't leave the key in the door overnight.. oh and btw, I filled the tank for you.

      "I have a sweet one.\n\nMy father is convinced that lilies were my late mother's favorite flower, because their wedding venue was filled to the brim with them and she was supposed to be the one who picked the flowers. He got her lilies for every birthday, anniversary, and whenever she was in the hospital (my mother was in poor health most of her life). When she passed away, the funeral was full of lilies, and he still sometimes puts a vase of lilies beside her urn.\n\nThe thing is, my mother once confessed to me that lilies weren't her favorite flower. She was fine with them, but she preferred morning glories and sunflowers. My domineering grandmother, however, told her those weren't classy enough for a wedding and hounded her about it until my mom gave in and let her pick lilies. Mom was actually pretty wounded by how dramatic the floral arrangements ended up being - another big, showy way for her mom to say, \"I'm right and you're wrong.\" When she later voiced this, my grandmother brushed it off with, \"Please, no one's going to remember a thing about your wedding.\"\n\nBut my dad remembered. He got her lilies every day of their honeymoon, and by the end of the week she'd gone from annoyed to deeply touched. He didn't know the backstory, he just wanted to make her happy, and in doing so he kind of stripped the negative association away from them. She told me she liked that *he* gave her lilies more than flowers themselves. They turned from a symbol of being ignored to a sign that somebody was thinking of her happiness.\n\nShe swore me to secrecy, and I'll take it to the grave. RIP, Mom.\n\nUPDATE: So as many of you have said, the \"take it to the grave\" line will mock me forever, because y'all convinced me to tell my dad today. As predicted, it only took a few hours to get a \"this u?\" text from a sibling, and we all quickly conferred and agreed I should call him in the morning. \n\nAnd Dad's first reply? \"Oh yeah, I know that, morning glories were her favorite. They just don't sell bouquets of those, so I'd get her the next best thing.\" Apparently she always said lilies were her favorite, but she talked about positive memories around morning glories so much that he put two and two together.\n\nHowever, he had *no* idea that my grandmother chose the wedding flowers, and was kinda pissed to find out(\"Doesn't that just...sound like her?\"\ud83d\ude12). He wishes Mom said something, but figures maybe she didn't want to \"win\" and still end up thinking about a fight with her mom every time she looked at the flowers. He's touched to hear he made them special for her, but did say she often told him how much she appreciated it, just left out the stuff about the wedding. Interestingly, he thinks Mom actually exaggerated the honeymoon lilies; he's pretty sure he only gave her lilies twice, on the way out and on the way back home. \n\nAs I said in another post, Dad does not know what Reddit is and does not care to learn, but he thought it was nice that the story made people happy. Then he launched into telling me why I need to get a new car already, and the thread was lost lmao.\n\n\"Aw, that's good, see, you should send your little stories to the New Yorker or something! People will read them, I keep telling you!\" - My dear old dad, who only vaguely understands what my side hustle is and has adorable faith in both me and the publishing industry as a result.\n\nDad did somehow completely miss that Mom liked sunflowers, to the point that I don't think he actually believes me (\"Nah, I think you misunderstood, she liked that Van Gogh painting, that's what she meant.\" \"The painting *of sunflowers,* Babo! That's why!\"). But you can't win 'em all. \ud83d\ude02 Thanks for wrapping this up in a bow, Reddit!",
